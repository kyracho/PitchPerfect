### Pitch Perfect Tuner 

Hi, I believe this is the first watchOS app that combines a metronome, a chromatic tuner, and a note player in one. 

Please note: 
- The chromatic tuner is accurate to around 1 Hz.
- The metronome at times begins ever-so-slighly off tempo, for the first few notes. It seems this could be due to the hardware limitations of the apple watch.
 
A simple and useful app for music lovers like myself :)

Thank you [@JPSim ](https://github.com/jpsim/ZenTuner) for the idea to use zero crossings instead of FFT for the chromatic tuner. It saved a lot of time and headaches.

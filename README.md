### Welcome to Pitch Perfect Tuner

Hi, this is my watchOS app that combines a metronome, a chromatic tuner, and a note player in one.

You can choose between the three functionalities from the menu.

The chromatic tuner works for a very wide range of frequencies, wide enough to be used with any musical instrument on the planet. The tuner itself is accurate to around 1 Hz, which is more accurate than the comparible tuner apps that I have found.

The note player plays the notes of the chromatic scale. This will be useful if you prefer the old-school tuning fork method of tuning. This method is more accurate than the chromatic tuner.

Thank you [@JPSim ](https://github.com/jpsim/ZenTuner) for the idea to use zero crossings for the chromatic tuner. My initial app using FFT was not accurate.

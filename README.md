# Pitch Perfect Tuner

The first watchOS app that plays the notes of the chromatic scale, intended to be used for providing a tuning reference.

The UI consists of "Play", "Stop", and two arrows. 

"Play" begins the note. The arrows increment the note (and begin the note, if it's not already playing). "Stop" ends the note.

The notes represent the middle octave of the piano:

- 261.63: C
- 277.18: C#
- 293.66: D
- 311.13: D#
- 329.63: E
- 349.23: F
- 369.99: F#
- 392.00: G
- 415.30: G#
- 440.00: A
- 466.16: A#
- 493.88: B
